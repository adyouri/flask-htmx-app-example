# Flask&HTMX Movie Watchlist Application Example

This demo application allows you to manage a movie watchlist with ease. You can add, edit, and delete movies from the list, as well as mark them as watched or unwatched with a simple click. The application uses Flask for the backend and the HTMX library for dynamic, interactive front-end functionality.
